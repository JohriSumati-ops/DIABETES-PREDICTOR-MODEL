# 🩺DIABETES-PREDICTOR❤️‍🩹
A machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on patient health data.
💉This project aims to help identify diabetes risk early by training a machine learning classifier on medical data.

🤖**Tech Stack:** 
Python, 
Pandas, 
NumPy, 
Scikit-Learn, 
Jupyter Notebook
🧠We experimented with SVM, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree. The final model uses Support Vector Machine (SVM).

📊**Accuracy:** 78%  
📊**Precision:** 75%  
📊**Recall:** 80%
